task: 
	recognise human activity from any data source

approach1:
	fit workers with accelerometers capturing their activities
		data gathered
	teach algorithm to recognise activities from data
		break data into segments
		each segment belongs to activity
		feed lots of examples
		concern:
			classification does not take into account surrounding signal, discrete independent snippets

approach2:
	detect repeating patters
		by autocorrelation. study it. fourier as well, it is all linked.
	classify repeated patterns
		concern: 
			may be unable to classify short repeated patterns e.g. steel fixing. 
            Need to check how short the repetition has to be. 

approach3:
    problem is similar to speech recognition
        investigate RNNs


final approach:
    gavin's data, 3 classes: walk, steel fix, null
    explore windows. split into train and test data. vary:
        - window size
        - handcrafted features 
        - classifier (SVM, NN, knn)
        - dim reduction (PCA, t-sne)
        and see separation
    once that is done, compare with RNN approaches


data verification, knn:
    legend:
    	1 blue
    	2 red
    features are:
        Average in each dimension [1 * n_dim]
        Standard deviation in each dimension [1 * n_dim]
        Average Absolute Difference  [1 * n_dim]
        Average Resultant Acceleration [1]
   
        #Plus window index
        #Start time
        #Window size
    Can we use PCA to visualise clusters? What does PCA do?
    	figure out
            eigenvectors, eigenvalues, diagonalisation, svd
    If we can use PCA to identify clusters, make a visualisation framework (look at jupyter, glueviz, orange3 first):
    	mouse over point, see corresponding window
    	see decision boundary drawn by NN in feature space
    		ONLY if NNs do what i think they do, i.e. extract their own features (ask Graham)
    	add handcrafted features, see changes on the fly
    	maybe select time segments
